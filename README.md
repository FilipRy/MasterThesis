# Edge Blockchain Provisioning for Mobile Edge Computing Applications
## Abstract

Blockchain in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environments has gained attention of researchers recently. Developers face new challenges when implementing blockchain-based applications in MEC. They have to make design decisions regarding choosing a suitable
deployment of blockchain features to MEC components, which include resource-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By running the blockchain features, MEC components have to carry out complex blockchain operations, which cause a lot of computational
overhead for the IoT devices. To help the developers to address the challenges, we propose a blockchain benchmarking framework in this thesis. The framework is able to evaluate different patterns of blockchain
interactions among MEC components. Various deployments of blockchain features to MEC components, involved in the interactions, are also benchmarked. To be able to
deploy and execute the blockchain features in the MEC components, we map the features into executable blockchain artefacts. Beside that, the framework can evaluate how
well the interactions perform when utilizing diverse configurations of the underlying infrastructure. Our framework measures performance and reliability of a benchmark via
following quality metrics: transaction acceptance rate and time, scalability and hardware utilization of infrastructureâ€™s resources.
Furthermore, we propose an experiment knowledge service, which manages data related to benchmarks. The purpose of the service is to provide knowledge gathered by the
benchmarks to developers. The developers can reuse the knowledge when designing their own blockchain-based applications in MEC environments.
We have implemented prototypes of the framework and the experiment knowledge service within the scope of this thesis. A set of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication sce-
narios have been utilized to identify various interaction patterns among MEC components. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework we have generated and benchmarked 324
experiments based on the identified interactions. We have explained what find outs do the benchmarks provide to the developers. Furthermore, we have shown examples of how
the developers can benefit from the experiments knowledge service.
